BORG colors
============

The Borg theme is mostly black and white, but there are several accent gray
colors, as well as a specific blue. These colors are noted here, for reference.

True Black: #000;

True White: #fff;

Blue: #007CBA;
  This color blue should be accessable on both a white background, and gray.

Backgroupd gray: #f7f7f7;
  This medium gray is used mainly as a background color. It's used on the
  full-width banners and behind views exposed filters.

Border gray: #E8E6E5;
  This darker gray is used as a border color for the regions that have a
  background, and on form elements. It should replace the use of the more
  standard #ccc;

Darker border gray: #d7d7d7;
  This even darker border color shoud be used where a 1px border is needed
  instead of 2px, for example, for inline node and comment links.

Disabled gray: #7D7D7D;
  This darkish gray should be used when an element on the page is disabled. It
  should replace the more standard #bbb; or #999;

Soft Black: #444b53;
  This softer color should be used for form input fields and places where the
  text needs to be slightly de-emphasized. It should be used to replace the more
  standard #555.
